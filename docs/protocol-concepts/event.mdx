# Event

An Event is a historical record of changes to a userâ€™s reputation data over time.

Events to track how reputation changes over time, giving users better insights into their progress. Think of it like Etherscan for the Builder Score: users will be able to see not just their current reputation state, but the complete history of how they got there.

Every change to reputation data is recorded as an Event with its old value, new value, and timestamp.

## Key Attributes:

- Represents a chronological log of changes to each [Data Point](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point):
- Each event stores: `old value`, `new value`, `timestamp`
- An Event does not include scoring information but is used to calculate scores when processed.

## Event vs Data Point

- A [Data Point](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point) shows the current state (e.g., total commits), and the Event tracks the history of changes leading to the current state.
- Just like Etherscan, where you see both the current token balance (state) and the transactions (events) that built up to it.
