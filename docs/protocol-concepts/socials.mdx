# Socials

Socials represent a builder's connected social media accounts and their associated data.

## What are Socials?

In Talent Protocol, a Social is a verified connection to a social platform like X/Twitter, Farcaster, Lens, or LinkedIn that:

- Provides additional context about a builder's reputation
- Contains metadata such as follower count, following count, and profile details
- Has been verified through OAuth or other verification methods

## Social Properties

Each Social connection includes:

- `source`: The platform (e.g., "lens", "farcaster", "github")
- `owner`: The account identifier on that platform
- `follower_count`: Number of followers
- `following_count`: Number of accounts followed
- `display_name`: Display name on that platform
- `name`: Username on the platform
- `profile_url`: Link to the social profile
- `image_url`: Profile picture URL
- `bio`: Profile description
- `location`: Location listed on the social platform
- `owned_since`: When the account was first verified

## Accessing Social Data

[API v2](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference-v2) provides dedicated endpoints to access a profile's social connections, allowing developers to:

- Verify cross-platform identity
- Assess social credibility
- Display social proof in applications
